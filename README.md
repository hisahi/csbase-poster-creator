# THIS SERVICE IS UNSAFE
This service is designed to be an antithesis to all
web applications with security that is well thought out.
It was created for the [Cyber Security Base course](https://cybersecuritybase.mooc.fi)
as an assignment to show just how easy it is to
make bad decisions in application design. This
application meets several of the top ten most common
security flaws in web applications as described
by OWASP in 2017.
